- **Deployment of Microsoft Azure**</br>
Deployment of the azure cloud virtual machine is the process of creating and configuring a virtual
machine (VM) in Azure that runs a specific operating system and applications. . Azure provides various
options and tools to deploy virtual machines in Azure, such as:
- The Azure portal, which is a browser-based user interface that allows you to create and manage VMs
and their associated resources.
- The Azure PowerShell module, which is a command-line tool that allows you to perform various tasks
on Azure resources using PowerShell scripts.
- The Azure CLI, which is a cross-platform command-line tool that allows you to perform various tasks
on Azure resources using commands.
- The Azure Resource Manager templates, which are JSON files that define the resources and
configurations for your VMs and other Azure resources.
