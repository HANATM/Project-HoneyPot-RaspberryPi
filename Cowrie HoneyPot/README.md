 <h1 center="align">what is a HoneyPot</h1>
 In cybersecurity, a honeypot is a decoy system or network that is intentionally designed to attract and deceive potential attackers. It is used as a security mechanism to gather information about the attackers, their methods, and their tools, allowing organizations to study and analyze their behavior in order to enhance their overall security posture. </br>
 A honeypot typically mimics a legitimate system or network and contains enticing data or vulnerabilities that might attract attackers. The honeypot appears as an attractive target, encouraging attackers to interact with it while being isolated from the actual critical systems and sensitive information of the organization.
